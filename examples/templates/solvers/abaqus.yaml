# Specification for the Abaqus solver
#
# In the example below, we register one output fields:
# - 'reaction_x'
# This is a quantity that is returned from the interface. When using the solver
# with an objective, use there names to define the prediction fields.
#
solver:
  #
  # Mandatory fields
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Solver name
  name: abaqus
  #
  # Path to the Abaqus binary
  abaqus_path: C:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat
  #
  # List of cases to run
  # The name of each case is the path to the input file that will be used
  # for the analysis. You can have multiple cases, each with its own input
  # file and fields.
  cases:
    # Example for a input file
    'sample.inp':
      # If the input has only one job this field is optional
      job_name: Job-1 # Job name to extract data
      # If the input has only one job this field is optional
      step_name: Step-1 # Step name to extract data
      # If the input has only one job this field is optional
      instance_name: PART-1-1 # Step name to extract data
      fields:
        'reaction_x':
          name: FieldsOutput # Name of the output field (mandatory)
          set_name: RF_SET # Name of the set to extract the field (mandatory)
          field: RF # Name of the Y field to extract (mandatory)
          # (e.g. S, U, RF, E or LE)
          x_field: U # Name of the X field to extract (mandatory)
          # (e.g. S, U, RF, E or LE)
          direction: x # Direction to extract the field data (mandatory)
  #
  # (Optional) Additional options for the solver
  # Given values are the default ones
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Number of parallel analyses to run
  # Only available when using multiple cases
  parallel: 1
  #
  # Path to store temporary analyses
  # By default, use a 'tmp' directory inside the output directory
  tmp_dir: output_dir/tmp
