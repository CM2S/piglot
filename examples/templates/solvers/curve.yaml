# Specification for the analytical curve generator solver

# In the example below, we register two output fields:
# - 'quadratic_curve'
# - 'exponential_curve'
# These are the quantities that are returned from the interface. When using the
# solver with an objective, use their names to define the prediction fields.

solver:
  #
  # Mandatory fields
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Solver name
  name: curve
  #
  # Verbosity level of the solver
  # Options:
  # - none: No output
  # - file: Both stdout and stderr are redirected to a file
  # - error: Stdout is redirected to a file, stderr is printed
  # - all: Both stdout and stderr are printed
  verbosity: none
  #
  # List of cases to run
  # The name of each case is the name of the output field to register. You can
  # have multiple cases.
  cases:
    # Register a 'quadratic_curve' output field that uses the quadratic curve
    # with the expression "<a> * x ** 2", where <a> is a parameter to be
    # optimised, the parametric variable is x, discretised in the range [-5, 5]
    # with 100 points.
    'quadratic_curve':
      expression: <a> * x ** 2 # Expression to use (note the <a> parameter)
      parametric: x # Parametric variable (this is not optimised)
      bounds: [-5, 5] # Bounds for the parametric variable
      points: 100 # Optional, 100 by default
    # Register a 'exponential_curve' output field that uses the exponential
    # curve with the expression "<a> * exp(t)", where <a> is a parameter to be
    # optimised, the parametric variable is t, discretised in the range [-2, 1]
    # with 50 points.
    'exponential_curve':
      expression: <a> * exp(t) # Expression to use (note the <a> parameter)
      parametric: t # Parametric variable (this is not optimised)
      bounds: [-2, 1] # Bounds for the parametric variable
      points: 50 # Optional, 100 by default
  #
  # (Optional) Additional options for the solver
  # Given values are the default ones
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Number of parallel analyses to run
  # Only available when using multiple cases
  parallel: 1
  #
  # Path to store temporary files
  # By default, use a 'tmp' directory inside the output directory
  tmp_dir: output_dir/tmp
