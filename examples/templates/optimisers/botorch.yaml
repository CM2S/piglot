# Specification for the BoTorch optimiser

optimiser:
  # Optimiser name (mandatory)
  name: botorch
  # 
  # (Optional) Additional hyperparameters for the optimiser.
  # Given values are the default ones.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Number of initial points to evaluate before starting the optimisation.
  # Note that the effective number of initial points is n_initial + 1, as the
  # initial guess is always evaluated.
  # Note: if using q > 1, these points will be evaluated in parallel.
  n_initial: 8
  #
  # Number of points to use for the test dataset. Disabled if set to 0.
  # Note: if using q > 1, these points will be evaluated in parallel.
  n_test: 0
  #
  # Acquisition function to use.
  # Available options: 'ucb', 'ei', 'pi', 'kg', 'qucb', 'qei', 'qpi', 'qkg'.
  # The 'q' prefix indicates the use of the q-batch version of the acquisition
  # function, normally evaluated with quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
  acquisition: ucb
  #
  # Beta parameter for the UCB acquisition function.
  beta: 1.0
  #
  # Whether to allow inference of the noise values of the objective.
  # Enable this option if the objective function is noisy or if you are 
  # experiencing numerical issues.
  noisy: False
  #
  # Number of q-batch evaluations to use for the acquisition function.
  # This allows generation of multiple candidate points per iteration,
  # which can be useful for parallel optimisation.
  # Can only be used with the 'q' prefix acquisition functions.
  q: 1
  #
  # Seed for the random number generators.
  seed: 1
  #
  # Load the dataset from a file.
  load_file: None
  #
  # Export the dataset to a file.
  export: None
